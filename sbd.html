										<h2>Job Site Blower – Optimized Performance and Cost Efficiency<br />
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/oldblower.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I designed a next-generation job site blower that significantly outperformed the previous version in every key aspect. My design achieved:</p>
									<ul>
										<li><span class="highlight"><b>75%</b> reduction</span> in power consumption</li>
										<li><span class="highlight"><b>2×</b> increase</span> in output performance</li>
										<li><span class="highlight"><b>$200,000+</b> annual savings</span> in manufacturing costs</li>
									</ul>
									<p>With a projected sales volume exceeding <span class="highlight">150,000 units</span>, this redesign delivered substantial improvements in efficiency and cost-effectiveness.</p>
									<p>I spearheaded the project from the initial brainstorming phase, conducting <span class="highlight">Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)</span> simulations for the axial fan, including both parametric and non-parametric studies. By analyzing data from over <span class="highlight">100 simulations</span>, I optimized the design to maximize performance while aligning with manufacturing constraints.</p>
									<p>Additionally, I performed <span class="highlight">tolerance stack-up analyses</span> and structural calculations for bending and stress to ensure robust performance. My contributions extended to the design of the housing, fan-motor sub-assembly, and electronics module, ensuring seamless integration of all components.</p>
									<p>This project was both a technical and strategic challenge—requiring innovation, rigorous engineering analysis, and cost-conscious design.</p>

									<h1></h1>
									<p>The existing aluminum extrusion track saw guide was a market leader but prone to damage due to mishandling by users and shipping-related impacts. I redesigned the track to address this issue, significantly improving durability while maintaining the precision and performance that customers expect.</p>
									
									<h2>Key Achievements of the Redesign:</h2>
									<ul>
										<li>30% reduction in shipping and warranty costs for the company</li>
										<li>Improved structural integrity without compromising accuracy</li>
										<li>Innovative design approach that redefined traditional track manufacturing</li>
									</ul>
									
									<p>This project required extensive tolerance stack-ups, stress analysis, straightness evaluations, and reliability testing to ensure the redesigned track met both performance and durability requirements. Rethinking conventional design methodologies while achieving cost savings and reliability improvements was a rewarding challenge.</p>
									
									<p>Additionally, I performed tolerance stack-up analyses and structural calculations for bending and stress to ensure robust performance. My contributions extended to the design of the housing, fan-motor sub-assembly, and electronics module, ensuring seamless integration of all components.</p>

									<h3>Speaker System Optimization – Woofer Spider & Port Design</h3>
									<p>As part of the speaker system design team, I contributed to developing the woofer spider, a critical component influencing sound quality and speaker longevity. My role involved conducting Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to evaluate deformation behavior, ensuring it remained within the acceptable design range for optimal performance.</p>
									<p>Additionally, I performed Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations on the speaker ports, analyzing airflow pressure and output velocity to enhance acoustic efficiency and minimize turbulence.</p>
									<p>This project combined structural and fluid dynamics analysis, allowing me to optimize component durability and airflow dynamics to deliver superior audio performance.</p>

										<h2>LED Light Pipe Design for Audio Systems<br />
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/light pipe.png" alt="" /></a>
									
										<p>In collaboration with Stanley Black & Decker, I contributed to the mechanical design of a light pipe for one of our audio systems, ensuring optimal illumination performance. My work involved:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Ray tracing analysis on the LED module to evaluate light output in lux</li>
											<li>Multiple design iterations to achieve the desired light distribution through the lens</li>
											<li>Simulation and optimization using TRACE-PRO software</li>
										</ul>
										<p>This project required a deep understanding of optical path design, material properties, and manufacturing feasibility to ensure efficient light transmission while maintaining design constraints.</p>

								<p>Along with the many exciting projects above, I also worked on other DEWALT tools.
                                    I designed a new housing for our grinder. Tested tools which include our drills, impacts, grinders, track saws, circular saws,
                                    miter saw, and recip saws.
